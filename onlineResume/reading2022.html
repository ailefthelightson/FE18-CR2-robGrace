    <h2> Personal Reading List 2022</h2>
    <br>
    <p>This was a varied year, topic-wise. I was doing full time law school with all the reading this entails and threw
        myself, at the same time, into learning the agricultural system of William Albrecht.
        Less time for my usual rabbit-holing, with case-law, policy white papers
        and mineral requirements of higher level plants chewing up my reading bandwidth.
